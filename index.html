      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Ayami. I am currently studying part time in the Coding Bootcamp
        program at the University of Washington. I have absolutely no experience or knowledge
        in this topic, but I am excited to challenge myself and learn new skills as well as
        collaborate with others studying under this program.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Sacramento, California. 
        I moved up to Seattle about 6 years ago.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>When I have free time, I love to go on day hikes. The PNW
        is absolutely beautiful. I also like to play video games on the PC
        or Nintendo Switch. I prefer open world and campaign types of games, I'm not too much of 
        the competitive type!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I am currently working my dream job as a registered nurse! This was
        my goal for years. I have been working as a nurse for a little over two
        years; one year working as a bedside nurse on a medsurg floor, and another 
        year as an operating room nurse (where I currently work). I've always 
        wanted to help others and I am learning that there are many ways that can help 
        people that doesn't involve direct patient care. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Seattle.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to explore other avenues of nursing. To provide some examples, 
        learning some skills from this coding bootcamp may allow me to gain entry 
        and experience for other nursing careers such as a data analyst RN or similar 
        roles in clinical informatics.</p>
